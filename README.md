# PWA-Progressive Web Apps

Examples for progressive web apps.

In this [repo](https://developersahab.github.io/pwa), we currently have:

* [addtohomescreen](pwa): An example set up to show how Add to home screen (addtohomescreen) works. [See it live here](https://developersahab.github.io/pwa/addtohomescreen/). This includes an icon and [manifest file](addtohomescreen/manifest.webmanifest) for allowing the app to be added to home screen, and a [simple service worker](addtohomescreen/service-worker.js) for making the site work offline.
